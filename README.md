2. entail.ipynb


easymix.ipynb has the data augmentation with easy mixup augmentation technique on HX HateXplain dataset. but by changing 
#to set up the dataset to train and test
lang = 'hx' #(can be 'hx' or 'latent' for 2 datasets)
model_choice =8 #(0-10 for different models)
We can train both datasets on easymixup with different models.
entail.ipynb has entailment technique on both HX HateXplain dataset, but by changing
#to set up the dataset to train and test
lang = 'hx' #(can be 'hx' or 'latent' for 2 datasets)
model_choice =8 #(0-10 for different models)
We can get total of 10 models trained for 2 datasets.
