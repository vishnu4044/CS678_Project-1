There are 2 files 
1. easymix.ipynb
2. entail.ipynb


easymix.ipynb has the data augmentation with easy mixup augmentation technique on HX HateXplain dataset, By changing few code bits <br />
lang = 'hx' #(can be 'hx' or 'latent' for 2 datasets)<br />
model_choice =8 #(0-10 for different models)<br />
We can train both datasets on easymixup with different models.<br />


entail.ipynb has entailment technique on both HX HateXplain dataset, by changing few code bits <br />
lang = 'hx' #(can be 'hx' or 'latent' for 2 datasets)<br />
model_choice =8 #(0-10 for different models)<br />
We can get total of 10 models trained for 2 datasets.<br />
